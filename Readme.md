# Auto.js
## Introduction

**yingshaoxo: I do this translation is not for letting this software getting better, I was hoping that someone who knows `Python` and `Java or Kotlin` both very well could make an automated tool in android with Python.**

This is a Javascript tool for android automation, It can be running at android without other dependencies. The goal for this app is to match JsBox and Workflow at Apple Store.

For using it, you have to compile it by yourself.

### Features
1. We use `Accessibility Services` as our base for automation. So you don't need to ROOT your phone.
2. You can use a floating window to record your phone touch movements. (the recorded file is a .js file)
3. We have a powerful UI selector. It's like the CSS selector in chrome debug tool (press F12 at your chrome to feel this sentence)
4. We support any javascript syntax, and we also have a built-in source code beautifier. You can think this app as an Javascript IDE.
5. You can use `e4x` syntax to write a custom UI. Then you can compile your own JS file to a standalone APK file.
6. We also support ROOT, so you can run shell command, do screen touch, and so on.
7. We have some functions like: screenshot, find_picture, find_color.
8. You can use this app as a `Tasker plugin`. With the App `Tasker`, you can do almost anything. (Although I think you already can do it with this app)
9. We have a built-in LayoutInspector


### Documentation
We have documentation, but so sadly, the original author refused to provide any English sentence. So it's Chinese only.

But you can still use `Google page translator` to read it. Thanks to Google.
